ðŸš€ Building a Content Engine with Streamlit! ðŸ“„âœ¨  

Just completed an exciting project to create a **Content Engine** for analyzing and comparing PDF documents! This system uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to highlight key differences between Form 10-K filings from companies like Alphabet, Tesla, and Uber.  

ðŸ”§ **Tech Stack Highlights**:  
- **Streamlit** for an intuitive and interactive frontend  
- **LangChain** for document processing and retrieval  
- **ChromaDB** as the vector store for embeddings  
- **DistilBERT** for lightweight and efficient embeddings  
- **DistilGPT2** as the local language model  

ðŸŽ¯ Designed to run efficiently on low-resource systems, this engine ensures seamless PDF comparison with actionable insights.  

Excited to explore more AI/ML applications! ðŸš€ Letâ€™s connect and discuss innovative ideas!
